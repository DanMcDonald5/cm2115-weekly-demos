# CM2115 Weekly Demo Repo

## Introduction

This repo provides a tidied-up and documented version of the demo code written during each week's Monday session. The aim is to allow you to view the code again, and play about with it so as to deepen your understanding of each individual topic in isolation.

Note that this isn't an alternative to the weekly Smart Home project, which you should still complete via the weekly lab exercises.

## Structure

Each topic is in its own package, within the `uk.ac.rgu` package (e.g., topic 2 is in `uk.ac.rgu.topic2`). Within each package, you'll find classes similar to those written during the demo, plus an `App` class. The `App` class for each topic contains a `main()` method allowing you to run each topic's demo in isolation.

## Exercises

At the top of each `App` class is a set of suggested exercises for you to expand the demo. These are entirely optional, and designed to allow you to consolidate your understanding. 

## Updates

The repo will be updated each week. You can obtain the latest version by  opening the Source Control pane in Visual Studio Code, clicking the three dots at the top and clicking **Pull**. This will add the newest code. Alternatively, if you have the project open then running `git pull` in the terminal will have the same effect.

## Topic listing

The following links will take you to the package in `src/main/java` and, where relevant, FXML files in `src/main/resources` for each topic. The list will be updated each week when the new code is added.
